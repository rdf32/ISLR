These problems were solved using the R programming language. The topic covered in (HW 1, HW 2) is linear regression and I showcase implementations of linear regression models. The topic covered in (HW 3, HW 4, HW 5, HW 6) is classification where I implement LDA, QDA, logistic regression, and KNN algorithms. The topic covered in HW 7 is resampling methods  which showcases LOOCV, K-fold Cross validation, and the validation set approach to making predictions. The topic covered in HW 8 is model selection.
